# Artist Statement
Timeless attraction is such a powerful yet abstract theme which is why I focused my artwork on evoking emotions of awe and existentialism. I focused on the attraction part of the theme literally by exploring the idea of compact solar system. Gravitational attraction is such a normalized part of life we forgot the power it holds in the abyss of space. By giving the viewer the power to play with this immense force, it invokes feelings of existentialism as they witness a common phenomenon abstracted onto scale of incomprehensible size. To complement the abstract nature of space, the structure of the artwork was inspired by the timeless aspect of the theme. Rather then a linear experience, my artwork is explored at the viewers leisure. The elements of the solar system persist no matter how long the viewer waits. The orbit of a planet of around the sun is a lengthy process and smallest nudge can send it off course. The viewer is free to explore these tiny changes and tweaks to better understand and appreciate a force they may take for granted. This artwork is focused on showing the power of gravity, allowing the users to view it, hear it and interact with it, giving it a visceral feel to the artwork. The goal was to have an artwork the viewer could play with for as long as they want, and do what they want.
