# Interaction Statement
This art works structure is simple. First the viewer is shown Earth. After a short narration they are required to zoom and view the whole solar system. This transition from one planet to many is done to fill the viewer with awe as they see the size of the solar system. The viewer is then walked through two tools they have at their disposal, the “Insert” and “Launch” tools. Due to these tools having somewhat nuanced functions, an introduction is necessary, so the viewer feels comfortable. After this the viewer is left to their own devices. The core concept of my artwork is that the viewer can do what they want with it. Its design is inherently that of a sandbox. A small solar system is already there however utilizing the “Launch” and “Insert” the viewer can build their own. In my opinion a viewer will always engage more with an artwork if they are able to meaningful interact with it, and this ethos has defined the design of my artwork. To drive home the themes of attraction and existentialism I’ve incorporated an abstract background track as well as audibly displayed the gravitational pull in certain areas. The stronger the gravitational pull on the mouse is, the louder the low, powerful note is. While not immediately noticeable it subconsciously makes the you recognize the strength of gravity near large objects like the sun.
